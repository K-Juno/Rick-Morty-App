# World of Ricky & Morty App

This repository is a very first group project by Alex, Barbara, Catharina, Deki, Dominic, Juni and Michael.

## Exercise

Together as a group we chose the following APIs to work with:

[Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)

The goal of this exercise was to work in a **group** and build a simple app which uses data from an API.

For this, the following quote by Rick was most fitting:

"What, So Everyoneâ€™s Supposed To Sleep Every Single Night Now?"
